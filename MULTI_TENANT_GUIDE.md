# Multi-Tenant Plugin Explained

## What is a Tenant?

A **tenant** is like having separate, isolated stores within one platform. Think of it like a shopping mall:

- **The Mall** = Your platform (Dabro)
- **Individual Stores** = Tenants (e.g., "Bob's Digital Art Store", "Sarah's Music Shop")

Each tenant has:
- Their own storefront (subdomain like `bob.dabro.com`)
- Their own products
- Their own Stripe account to receive payments
- Complete data isolation from other tenants

**Real-World Example:**
```
Platform: dabro.com

Tenants:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bob.dabro.com (Bob's store with his digital art)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sarah.dabro.com (Sarah's store with her music)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ alex.dabro.com (Alex's store with his ebooks)
```

## What is the Multi-Tenant Plugin?

The `@payloadcms/plugin-multi-tenant` plugin **automatically isolates data** between different tenants. Without it, you'd see everyone's products mixed together!

### What It Does For You

**Without the plugin:**
```
Products Collection:
- Product 1 (Bob's)
- Product 2 (Sarah's)
- Product 3 (Bob's)
- Product 4 (Alex's)

‚ùå Bob sees ALL products, including Sarah's and Alex's!
```

**With the plugin:**
```
When Bob logs in ‚Üí Only sees his products
When Sarah logs in ‚Üí Only sees her products
When Alex logs in ‚Üí Only sees his products

‚úÖ Automatic data isolation!
```

### Configuration in Your Project

Looking at your `src/payload.config.ts`:

```typescript
multiTenantPlugin({
  collections: {
    products: {},  // Products are scoped to tenants
  },
  userHasAccessToAllTenants: (user) =>
    Boolean(user.roles?.includes("super-admin")),
})
```

This means:
- **Products** are automatically filtered by tenant
- Only users with `super-admin` role can bypass this filtering

## What is the Super-Admin Role?

The **super-admin** is the platform owner (you!) who needs to see and manage everything across all tenants.

### Role Comparison

| Feature | Regular User (Tenant Owner) | Super Admin (Platform Owner) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Can see own products | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Can see other tenant's products | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Can manage all tenants | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Can access platform analytics | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Use case | Store owner managing their shop | Platform owner managing entire marketplace |

### Example Scenario

**Bob's View (Regular Tenant Owner):**
```
Visits Payload Admin ‚Üí Sees only:
- His tenant: "Bob's Digital Art"
- His 5 products
- His orders
```

**Your View (Super Admin):**
```
Visits Payload Admin ‚Üí Sees:
- All tenants: Bob's, Sarah's, Alex's stores
- All products from all stores (50+ products)
- All orders across the platform
- Platform revenue and analytics
```

## How Data Flows in Your Multi-Tenant System

### 1. User Signs Up
```typescript
// User creates account
User {
  email: "bob@example.com",
  roles: ["user"]  // Regular user, not super-admin
}
```

### 2. User Creates a Tenant (Store)
```typescript
// Bob creates his storefront
Tenant {
  name: "Bob's Digital Art",
  slug: "bob",  // Becomes bob.dabro.com
  stripeAccountId: "acct_123...",
  stripeDetailsSubmitted: true
}
```

This is defined in `src/collections/Tenants.ts`.

### 3. User Creates Products
```typescript
// Bob creates a product
Product {
  name: "Sunset Painting",
  price: 29.99,
  tenant: "bob",  // üëà Automatically linked by multi-tenant plugin
}
```

**The Magic:** The plugin automatically adds the `tenant` relationship behind the scenes!

### 4. Data Queries Are Automatically Scoped

When Bob fetches products via tRPC:

```typescript
// In your tRPC procedure
const products = await ctx.payload.find({
  collection: "products",
  // Plugin automatically adds: where: { tenant: { equals: bob's-tenant-id } }
});
// Bob only sees his products! ‚úÖ
```

When you (super-admin) fetch products:

```typescript
// Same code, but you see ALL products from all tenants! ‚úÖ
const products = await ctx.payload.find({
  collection: "products",
  // No tenant filter applied for super-admins
});
```

## Practical Benefits

### For Store Owners (Tenants)
- Can't accidentally delete other people's products
- Can't see competitor pricing
- Their dashboard is clean and focused
- Privacy and data security

### For You (Platform Owner)
- Manage the entire marketplace from one admin panel
- Handle support issues across all stores
- Monitor platform health and revenue
- Enforce platform policies

### For Development
- Don't write manual filtering code for every query
- Automatic security - can't accidentally expose data
- Centralized tenant logic in one place
- Easy to add more multi-tenant collections

## Adding More Multi-Tenant Collections

Currently only `products` are scoped to tenants. You might want to add:

```typescript
multiTenantPlugin({
  collections: {
    products: {},
    orders: {},      // Each tenant sees only their orders
    customers: {},   // Each tenant has their own customer list
    analytics: {},   // Each tenant sees their own stats
  },
  userHasAccessToAllTenants: (user) =>
    Boolean(user.roles?.includes("super-admin")),
})
```

## Complete User Journey Example

Let's walk through a real scenario:

### Step 1: Bob Registers on Your Platform

```typescript
POST /api/users/register
{
  email: "bob@artist.com",
  password: "secure123",
  name: "Bob Smith"
}

// Created in database:
User {
  id: "user_bob_123",
  email: "bob@artist.com",
  roles: ["user"]  // Not a super-admin
}
```

### Step 2: Bob Creates His Store

```typescript
POST /api/tenants/create
{
  name: "Bob's Digital Art Gallery",
  slug: "bobsart"  // Will be accessible at bobsart.dabro.com
}

// After Stripe verification:
Tenant {
  id: "tenant_bob_456",
  name: "Bob's Digital Art Gallery",
  slug: "bobsart",
  stripeAccountId: "acct_stripe_789",
  stripeDetailsSubmitted: true,
  owner: "user_bob_123"  // Linked to Bob's user account
}
```

### Step 3: Bob Adds Products

```typescript
POST /api/products/create
{
  name: "Mountain Sunset Digital Print",
  price: 29.99,
  description: "Beautiful landscape art"
}

// Multi-tenant plugin automatically adds tenant:
Product {
  id: "prod_001",
  name: "Mountain Sunset Digital Print",
  price: 29.99,
  tenant: "tenant_bob_456"  // üëà Added automatically!
}
```

### Step 4: Sarah Also Creates a Store (Separately)

```typescript
// Sarah's tenant
Tenant {
  id: "tenant_sarah_789",
  name: "Sarah's Music Downloads",
  slug: "sarahmusic"
}

// Sarah's product
Product {
  id: "prod_002",
  name: "Piano Album Vol 1",
  price: 15.99,
  tenant: "tenant_sarah_789"  // Sarah's tenant
}
```

### Step 5: What Each User Sees

**When Bob visits the Payload Admin:**
```typescript
// Bob queries products
const bobProducts = await payload.find({
  collection: "products"
});

// Returns:
[
  {
    id: "prod_001",
    name: "Mountain Sunset Digital Print",
    tenant: "tenant_bob_456"
  }
  // Sarah's product is NOT visible to Bob! ‚úÖ
]
```

**When you (super-admin) visit the Payload Admin:**
```typescript
// Same query, different results
const allProducts = await payload.find({
  collection: "products"
});

// Returns:
[
  {
    id: "prod_001",
    name: "Mountain Sunset Digital Print",
    tenant: "tenant_bob_456"
  },
  {
    id: "prod_002",
    name: "Piano Album Vol 1",
    tenant: "tenant_sarah_789"
  }
  // You see everything! ‚úÖ
]
```

## Security in Action

### Scenario: Bob Tries to Access Sarah's Product

```typescript
// Bob attempts to update Sarah's product
const result = await payload.update({
  collection: "products",
  id: "prod_002",  // Sarah's product
  data: {
    price: 0.99  // Trying to change Sarah's price!
  }
});

// Result: Error! Product not found
// The multi-tenant plugin blocks access ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario: You (Super-Admin) Handle a Support Request

```typescript
// Customer reports issue with Sarah's product
// You can access it because you're super-admin
const product = await payload.findByID({
  collection: "products",
  id: "prod_002"  // Sarah's product
});

// Success! You can help resolve the issue ‚úÖ
```

## Summary

- **Tenant** = Individual storefront within your platform (like individual shops in a mall)
- **Multi-Tenant Plugin** = Automatic data isolation between stores (each shop only sees their inventory)
- **Super-Admin** = Platform owner who manages everything (mall manager who oversees all shops)
- **Regular Users** = Store owners who only see their own data (individual shop owners)

Your platform is like **Shopify** or **Gumroad** - multiple independent sellers under one roof, each with their own branded storefront and complete data privacy! üè™

## Next Steps

1. Create a user account with `super-admin` role to test platform-wide access
2. Create multiple test tenants to see data isolation in action
3. Consider adding more collections to the multi-tenant configuration (orders, customers, etc.)
4. Implement subdomain routing to serve tenant-specific storefronts
